# MyApp

## Prerequisites

- Install node 16.15.0
- Install Xcode (Version 14.1)
- Install android studio (Version 2021.3)
- Install yarn using `npm i -g yarn` (Version 1.22.18)

## Dependencies

- axios - for networking.
- react-native-config - to manage environments.

## Instructions to setup dev env

- From the root project folder run `yarn install` to install dependencies
- From the root project folder run `yarn android` to run the Android app
- Goto ios folder and run the `pod install`(use `arch -x86_64 pod install` for apple chip machine) command. (If you donâ€™t have cocoapods installed, please install them)
- Cocoa pod setup - https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html - (Version 1.11.3)
- From the root project folder run `yarn ios` to run the ios app (Please run anyone at a time, either Android or iOS)
- If the simulators are not set up, please set up them from Xcode or android studio.

## To run other environments

-  Delete .env file from the project root
- `yarn start --reset-cache`

## For production build run

- `yarn ios`
- `yarn android`

## For staging build run

- `yarn ios-stag`
- `yarn android-stag`

## Deep-linking

## What is deep-linking

- Deep linking is a mobile app development technique that enables a user to directly access specific content within an app. In the case of resetting a password, deep linking can allow a user to directly access the reset password screen within the mobile app, bypassing the need to navigate through the app's homepage and menus to find the reset password option. This can enhance the user experience and make the password reset process more convenient for the user.

- `npx uri-scheme add MyAppapp:// --ios`
- `npx uri-scheme open MyAppapp:// --ios`

- `npx uri-scheme add MyAppapp:// --android`
- `npx uri-scheme open MyAppapp:// --android`

- `npx uri-scheme open MyAppapp://SignIn --android`
- `npx uri-scheme open MyAppapp://SignIn --ios`

## Example for passing value to some screen with deep-linking

- `npx uri-scheme open MyAppapp://ResetPassword/8656603b-7c9a-426b-8952-a8e08f463516 --android`
- `npx uri-scheme open MyAppapp://ResetPassword/8656603b-7c9a-426b-8952-a8e08f463516 --ios`

## Link new custom fonts

## Deployment steps

### Android 

- Generate a Signed APK: In Android Studio, select "Build" from the top menu and then select "Generate Signed Bundle / APK." Follow the prompts, use an existing keystore(located at `<project root>/MyAppBuildCertificates/Android/MyAppBuildCertificates/Android/MyAppAppKeystoreDetails.rtf`) and then generate a signed APK.
- Open the Google Play Console and select "MyApp" app.
- Click on "Setup" in the left-hand menu and then select "Internal App Sharing."
- Agree to the terms and conditions.
- Drag and drop or browse for the APK file you want to upload.
- Once the upload is complete, a new page will appear with a link to the app. You can copy this link and share it with your testers.
- Before sharing the app with your testers, you can configure the release options such as release name, release notes, and track (beta or alpha).
- To invite testers, go to the "Internal Testers" or "External Testers" page and add their email addresses.
- Share the link with your testers, and they can download and test your app on their Android devices.
- Note that it may take a few hours for the uploaded APK to be available to testers, and the app needs to be published to an internal track before it can be shared with testers. Also, make sure that the APK is signed with the same keystore used to sign the app's previous versions.

### iOS

- Log in to your Apple Developer account and navigate to the "App Store Connect" portal.
- Click on the "My Apps" tab, and select your app. If you haven't already created a record for your app, click on "Add App" to create one.
- Prepare your app for distribution by creating a distribution build. This involves compiling your code, signing your app with a distribution certificate, and creating an archive of your app.(certificates and provisioning profiles are located at `<project root>/MyAppBuildCertificates/iOS`)
- Upload your build to App Store Connect. Navigate to the "TestFlight" tab, click on the "Builds" section, and then click on the plus icon to upload your build.
- Prepare for testing by inviting testers to your app. Navigate to the "Testers" section, and invite testers by email address. You can also create groups of testers for specific builds or features.
- Distribute your app to testers. Navigate to the "Builds" section, and select the build you want to distribute. From there, you can choose to distribute the build to all testers or select specific groups of testers.
- Monitor feedback from testers. Navigate to the "TestFlight" tab, and select the "Feedback" section to view feedback from testers. You can also view crash logs and other diagnostic information to help identify and fix any issues with your app.
